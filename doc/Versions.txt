General version update information:/

               (caused fail in file save).
.97a: Added (naive) support for tying multi-events (divisi notes) in modern
      notation.
      Bug fix: partial ties sometimes not displaying at right edge of display
               (edge case!).
               Outdated Ctrl-D function creating bogus editorial/variant markers;
               now toggles editorial.
.97: Switched to Apache ANT for builds, redid directory structure (src/build/etc).
     Viewer: Added Error to selection types for variants.
     Editor: Added "Set reading as default" in variant reading editor.
             Added "Delete modern text" dialog.
     Bug fixes: Default version display in variant display frames/critical notes
                (displayed versions which were missing the current voice or section).
                Variant accidental detection (false negatives).
                Var. clef/key signature issues in page rendering.
                Var. modern notation translation issues. (7/11)
.96: Format: Added editorial modern text flag (italicized in visualizers).

     Editor: added "Open in CMME Viewer" feature.
     Bug fixes: Mensurstrich display with missing parts.
                Security access exceptions in JRE 1.6 when trying to open network 
                connection from applet back to originating host when invoked from 
                Javascript (fixed with doPrivileged() and code decoupling in Viewer.Main).
                Re-initialization bugs in JRE (closing and then re-opening an applet calls
                init() again but retains old objects/data). 
                MusicXML generator: add empty measures when voice is not in section. (6/11)
.95: renamed DataStruct.MusicXMLReaderWriter to MusicXMLReader, added 
     Gfx.MusicXMLGenerator (MusicXML generation is based on score-rendered data)
     Added MusicXML generator (.955)
     Viewer:    Added GUI elements for modern note shapes / reduction.
                Implemented basic modern note shape/tie view.
                Converted music/measure timing system more completely from double
                to Proportion.
                MIDI playback now supports tied notes properly (.956).

                values (in chant sections).
                Improved error-handling in file save (as) functions.
     Revised detection routine for variant accidentals, to avoid marking clef+key-sig
     repetitions as variant accidentals.
     Started implementing Text sections.
     Added basic MusicXML reader (partwise only, limited data). (5/10)
.92: Lowered default MIDI volume/NOTE_ON velocity (to avoid distortion on some
     implementations).
     Editor:    General Information Window: added Insert before/after choice, put
                scroll pane around voice pane when necessary (to avoid window growing
                beyond screen limits).
     Bug fixes: MIDI playback for more than 8 voices used percussion channels; for
                more than 16 voices used unavailable channel numbers (used one MIDI
                channel for every voice unnecessarily).
                MIDI playback did not stop when exiting applet / closing editor window.
                MIDI playback caused exception/score disappearance when only one measure
                exists. (9/09)

     Bug fix: Generate parts PDF caused crash. (8/09)
.9:  Editor: * new keys: Ctrl-. or Mouse Button 2 to display variants.
             * Fixed several variant-input bugs especially involving multiple
               variants in one location.
             * Added GUI elements to variant reading popup (delete version from
               reading, consolidate identical readings).
             * Implemented variant-creation for all remaining event modifications
               (e.g., miscellaneous coloration change, ligature type change).
             * Fixed file-saving bug where each section was always recorded as
               having the maximum number of voices.
             * Positioning of new rests now depends on previous note/rest event.
             * Automatically consolidates identical variant readings upon saving file.

     Viewer: * Hides Commentary panel when commentary display is turned off.
             * Voices missing in currently displayed version are displayed in gray.
             * Encapsulated zoom controls in separate ZoomControl object (used in main
               window and ScorePagePreviewWin etc.).
             * Rewrote score renderer to split into two phases (for conceptual clarity
               and ease of extension; old one-pass system had become too complex for
               effective modification):
               1. create rendered event list for each voice, replacing/removing events
                  as necessary
               2. assign x-positions to all rendered events to align in score
             * Added verbose error message when failing to open a file created by a
               later version of the software.
             * File menu: added "About this edition..."
             * Added visualization line for audio playback location.

               score.
     Format: * Added optional ID attribute to Events.
             * Modified DotData to include option of relative staff location and
               pointer to Note (for dots of addition).
             * Added PublicNotes element to General Info section.
             * Added optional PrincipalSource info to Section Attributes.
             * Dot position described as Pitch instead of staff space.
             * Editorial accidentals represented as numeric pitch offsets instead of
               accidental type and number of applications.
             * Now includes meta-data for "default" variant version.
             * Added missing voices list to variant version declaration.
             * Restored Lacuna event type, now with untimed Begin and End markers to be
               used within variant readings to show source-specific lacunae.
             * Added Tie information to Note (for ties actually appearing in sources).
             * Added event attributes "Editorial" and "Error".
             * Added missing versions list in each music section.
             * Added (optional) proportions to mensurations for playback/display.
             * Added flag to mark mensuration sign as not affecting measure structure
               of overall score.
     Bug fixes: * Rendering crash when "rhythmic error" variant was followed
                  directly by another variant.
                * Adding new version prevented further switching of versions on
                  score.
                * File was marked as modified when loading new sections into a
                  SectionAttribsFrame.
                * Displacement of variant when creating Multi-Event within variant.
                * Various crashes when altering/deleting events across variant borders.
                  Crash when jumping cursor to Home or End if current voice was not used
                  in first or last section (respectively).
                * Event Information window incorrectly claimed that items were highlighted
                  when attempting to grow highlight beyond section boundaries.
                * Crashes and event-length problems when dealing with dots and ligatures
                  in variants.
                * Key signature bug involving clefs in variant versions.
                * Adding new voice didn't work properly with already-existing chant
                  sections.
                * Editor crash when inserting section break in a section with reduced
                  scoring. (3/09)

     Replaced music-font-loading/rendering system to use standard Java
     libraries.
     Replaced arbitrary view-scaling code with fast implementation (changes

     in format) and display of double(/triple etc)-accidentals.
     Added score view laid out in pages/staff-systems (print preview).
     Implemented score-layout PDF generation. (7/06)
.7:  Moved unscored part renderer to separate public class (out of

                 now only loads icon images at start (rather than for each
                 window). (3/06)
.68: Converted note/rest-length system from breve to minim base (i.e., now
     1/1 = 1 minim).

             into a single event editor frame.
             Started mensuration editor.
