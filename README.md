# CMME early music notation editor/viewer

This is the code for the graphical early music transcription tool developed as part of the Computerized Mensural Music Editing Project, in use at [www.cmme.org](http://www.cmme.org).

NB: This is some legacy-ass Java code, cobbled together over many years. I hope eventually to ditch it and rewrite from the ground up as a web app.

## Building

Use ANT. The default task in build.xml compiles JARs into the dist/ directory.

## Tests

What are those?
